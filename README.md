# NC Crime Map

The **NC Crime Map** is an interactive map that shows violent crimes across North Carolina. Users can see the total violent crime in each county and the types of violent crimes—Murder, Rape, Robbery, and Aggravated Assault—happening in different cities.  

The map is built with **Leaflet.js** for interactive maps, **Leaflet-Ajax** to load the data, **Chroma.js** for coloring the counties based on crime levels, and **Font Awesome 6** icons to show different crime types. Counties are colored to show the total violent crime, and cities have icons that represent the kind of violent crime reported.  

The data comes from two GeoJSON files: `muni.geojson` for counties and `crimes.geojson` for cities. The map also includes a legend and a scale bar to make it easier to understand.  

This project shows the type of crimes in NC in 2020
